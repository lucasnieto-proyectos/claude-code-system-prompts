# My Company Context

## Purpose

Some skills produce better output when they understand the user's company — what it sells, its ICP, and competitive positioning. This context lets the LLM tailor account research, call prep, and outreach to the user's specific product and value prop.

## How to Gather Company Context

1. **Me object** — Fetch the `Me` object. It includes the user's company name and title.
2. **CR lookup** — Look up the user's company in Common Room as an Organization to get firmographics, industry, and description.
3. **Web search** — If CR data is sparse or looks stale, search the web for the user's company customer case studies, product pages, and marketing materials. This fills gaps with fresh positioning context that CR firmographics alone don't capture.
4. **Session context** — Check if the user has already described their product, ICP, or value prop in the current conversation.
5. **Ask once** — If company context isn't available from the above, ask the user once per session: "To tailor my recommendations, can you briefly describe what your company does and who your ideal customers are?"

## How to Use It

- **Account research (reasoning step):** Position findings relative to the user's ICP — "This account fits your ICP because..."
- **Call prep (talking points):** Frame talking points around the user's product value, not generic advice
- **Compose outreach (value bridge):** Ground the pitch in the user's specific product and positioning
- **Prospecting:** Use ICP criteria as default filter suggestions when the user doesn't specify criteria
