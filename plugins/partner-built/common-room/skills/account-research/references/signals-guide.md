## Signal Interpretation Principles

1. **Recency matters most.** A signal from yesterday far outweighs one from 6 months ago. Always note timestamps.
2. **Signal clusters > single signals.** Multiple signals in the same direction are much stronger than any individual one.
3. **Absence of signals is a signal.** Minimal usage + no community engagement at a paid account = risk indicator.
4. **Contextualize against account stage.** Trial: conversion signals dominate. Mature customer: expansion and churn-risk. Prospect: intent signals are paramount.
