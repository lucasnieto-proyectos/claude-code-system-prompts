# Weekly Prep Brief — Structure and Edge Cases

## Briefing Depth Guidelines

Calibrate research depth based on account type:

| Account Type | Depth |
|-------------|-------|
| Strategic account (large, high ARR) | Full — account + all attendees |
| Active opportunity (open deal) | Full — with emphasis on deal signals |
| Renewal within 90 days | Full — with emphasis on risk/health signals |
| Mid-market customer, routine call | Standard — abbreviated account + key attendee |
| Small account, quick check-in | Minimal — 3-4 bullets, single attendee |
| Brand new prospect (first meeting) | Full contact + account — first impressions matter |

## Week Overview Priorities

Flag these situations prominently at the top of the brief:

- Trial expiring within 7 days, renewal due within 30 days, or churn risk signals detected
- Open critical support tickets or unresolved escalations
- Expansion signals worth raising in the call
- Executive stakeholder or new champion attending
- Champion recently changed jobs or competitive signals in the account
- Recent company funding, product milestone, or strong community advocacy (use as opener)

## Edge Cases

- **No Common Room data:** Note it explicitly, run external web research, recommend the rep check with their team for offline context.
- **Multiple meetings with the same company:** Research the account once, share across meetings, differentiate by attendees and objectives.
- **7+ meetings in a week:** Ask whether to prioritize full research for specific accounts or run abbreviated prep for all; default to full for strategic.
- **Same-day meeting:** Skip confirmation, produce compressed version (company snapshot + top signals + 1-2 talking points), mark as "[Quick Prep]".
- **Cancelled meetings:** Exclude silently; if status is unclear, include with "[Status unclear — confirm this meeting is still on.]"
