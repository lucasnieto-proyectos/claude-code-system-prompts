# Call Types — Prep Guide

## Identifying the Call Type

If the user doesn't specify, infer from context: trial + early signals = Discovery/Demo; active CRM opportunity = Demo/Evaluation/Negotiation; existing customer + renewal date = Renewal/QBR; expansion signals = Expansion; support tickets + declining usage = Save call.

## Discovery Call

**Goal:** Understand the prospect's pain, context, and fit.

- Identify what signals triggered the meeting and prepare open-ended questions tied to those signals
- Form a hypothesis about their primary use case from Spark persona and activity data
- **Talking point structure:** Signal -> question -> how you might help

## Demo Call

**Goal:** Show the product in context of their specific needs.

## Expansion Conversation

**Goal:** Identify and close upsell/cross-sell or seat expansion.

- Lead with usage data demonstrating value already delivered
- Present expansion as a natural next step tied to their business outcomes

## Renewal / Retention Call

**Goal:** Secure renewal; address any risk.

- Check engagement trend, open support tickets, and champion status
- Quantify value delivered (usage stats, outcomes) as renewal justification

## QBR (Quarterly Business Review)

**Goal:** Review progress, align on strategy, deepen executive relationship.

- Analyze 90-day signal trends and breadth of adoption across teams
