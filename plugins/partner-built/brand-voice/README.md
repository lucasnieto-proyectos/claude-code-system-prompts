# Brand Voice Plugin

A [Tribe AI](https://tribe.ai) plugin for Claude Cowork. Built as a Cowork launch partner.

The brand knowledge that makes a company recognizable rarely lives anywhere useful. It's in a deck from 2022, a Confluence page no one's updated since the last rebrand, and the instincts of a few senior people who've been there long enough to just know. When sales reps are generating outreach with AI and new hires are producing content in their first week, that's exactly what gets lost.

Brand Voice transforms scattered brand materials into enforceable AI guardrails. It searches across Confluence, Google Drive, Box, SharePoint, Slack, Gong, and Granola to discover how your company actually communicates — then creates LLM-ready brand guidelines and validates every piece of AI-generated content against them. Claude doesn't just write faster. It writes like you.

## Features

### 1. Brand Discovery
Your brand knowledge is buried across Notion, Confluence, Google Drive, Gong, Slack, and years of sales calls and meeting transcripts. Brand Voice searches across all of it — style guides, pitch decks, email templates, transcripts, design systems — to distill your strongest brand signals into a single, current source of truth. Grounded in how your best people actually communicate, not just how a style guide from three years ago says you should.

**Slash Command:** `/brand-voice:discover-brand`

```
/brand-voice:discover-brand
/brand-voice:discover-brand Acme Corp
```

### 2. Guideline Generation
Synthesizes your materials into LLM-ready guidelines: voice pillars, tone parameters, a "We Are / We Are Not" framework that gives Claude a clear operating boundary, and terminology standards that reflect real company language — not aspirational copy. The same guardrails that keep veteran teams on-brand mean new hires produce quality content in week one instead of month three.

**Slash Command:** `/brand-voice:generate-guidelines`

```
/brand-voice:generate-guidelines
/brand-voice:generate-guidelines from the discovery report and these 3 PDFs
```

### 3. Brand Voice Enforcement
Every piece of AI-generated content — sales emails, proposals, marketing pages, press releases — gets written against your guidelines from the start. Voice stays constant while tone flexes by context: formality, energy, and technical depth adapt automatically for cold emails vs. enterprise proposals vs. LinkedIn posts. Tone drift and positioning gaps get caught before they reach a prospect or investor.

**Slash Command:** `/brand-voice:enforce-voice`

```
/brand-voice:enforce-voice Draft a cold email to a VP of Sales at a mid-market SaaS company
/brand-voice:enforce-voice Write a LinkedIn post announcing our new feature
```

### Open Questions
When the plugin encounters ambiguity it can't resolve — conflicting documents, missing guidelines, stated vs. practiced brand divergence — it surfaces open questions for team discussion. Every question includes an agent recommendation, turning ambiguity into a "confirm or override" interaction rather than a dead end.

## MCP Connectors

| Connector | URL | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| **Notion** | `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp` | Discovery backbone — federates across connected Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive, Slack, Jira. Also stores output guidelines. |
| **Atlassian** | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` | Deep Confluence search + Jira context for Atlassian-heavy enterprises |
| **Box** | `https://mcp.box.com` | Cloud file storage — official brand docs, shared decks, and style guides often live here |
| **Microsoft 365** | `https://microsoft365.mcp.claude.com/mcp` | SharePoint, OneDrive, Outlook, Teams — enterprise document storage and email templates |
| **Figma** | `https://mcp.figma.com/mcp` | Brand design systems — color, typography, design tokens inform voice |
| **Gong** | `https://mcp.gong.io/mcp` | Enterprise conversation intelligence — sales call transcripts and analysis |
| **Granola** | `https://mcp.granola.ai/mcp` | Meeting intelligence — transcripts and notes from sales, customer, and strategy meetings |

### Native Integrations

These platforms are native Claude integrations — no MCP connector install needed. They are available as tools when the user connects them in Claude Desktop or Cowork.

| Integration | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Google Drive** | Shared brand documents, style guides, marketing materials, Google Docs and Slides |
| **Slack** | Brand discussions, channel searches, pinned brand guidelines, informal voice patterns |

## Quick Start

1. Install the plugin and open Claude Cowork
2. Connect at least one platform (Notion recommended — it federates across Google Drive, SharePoint, Slack, and Jira)
3. Run `/brand-voice:discover-brand` — Claude searches your connected knowledge bases for brand materials automatically
4. Run `/brand-voice:generate-guidelines` to produce a durable set of guidelines from the discovery report
5. Use `/brand-voice:enforce-voice` when creating content — sales emails, proposals, LinkedIn posts, anything customer-facing

You can also point Claude at specific documents if you prefer. Either way, it walks you through the process.

Brand Voice currently works at the individual level — team-wide enforcement is coming soon.

### Per-Project Settings

Copy `settings/brand-voice.local.md.example` to `.claude/brand-voice.local.md` in your project and fill in your company name, enabled platforms, and known brand material locations.

## Architecture

**Skills** provide domain knowledge and orchestrate workflows. They activate automatically based on user intent.

**Agents** handle heavy autonomous work — searching platforms, analyzing documents, parsing transcripts, generating content, and validating quality.

**Commands** are explicit user entry points that trigger the skill workflows.

**Key design decisions:**
- Voice is constant, tone flexes — a clear mental model for enforcement
- Discovery agent is autonomous but accountable — shows its work with provenance and conflicts
- Open questions are a feature, not a failure — every ambiguity includes a recommendation
- Progressive disclosure — frontmatter is lean, SKILL.md is focused, detail lives in references/
- Notion AI Search as federated discovery engine — one API searches 8+ platforms via connected sources
- Google Drive and Slack are native Claude integrations — no MCP connector needed
