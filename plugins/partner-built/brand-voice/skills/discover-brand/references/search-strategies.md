## Cross-Platform Search Tips

### Maximizing Coverage
1. Start with Notion AI Search (broadest coverage via federation)
2. Follow up with Confluence for enterprise documentation
3. Check Google Drive for official brand documents
4. Check Box for cloud-stored brand documents
5. Search SharePoint/OneDrive for enterprise files
6. Search Slack for brand discussions and decisions
7. Search Gong for conversational brand patterns
8. Search Granola for meeting transcripts and notes
9. Review Figma for design-embedded brand guidelines

### Avoiding Duplicates
- Track source URLs to detect the same document across platforms
- When the same content appears on multiple platforms, prefer the most recently updated version
- Note when Notion federation returns results from other platforms to avoid double-searching

### Recency Focus
- Focus on content from the last 12 months for operational, conversational, and contextual sources
- Only search further back when looking for explicit brand documents (style guides, brand books)
- When results include older content, prefer the most recently updated version
- Flag any non-AUTHORITATIVE source older than 12 months — it may reflect outdated positioning

### Handling No Results
- If a platform returns zero results, try broader queries ("marketing", "sales")
- Check if the platform is actually connected and authenticated
- Note the gap in the discovery report — the absence of content on a platform is itself useful information
