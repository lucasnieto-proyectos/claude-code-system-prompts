# Voice Constant, Tone Flexes

The core mental model for brand voice enforcement: voice is constant, tone flexes by context.

## The Distinction

**Voice** is WHO the brand is — personality, values, identity. It never changes regardless of channel, audience, or content type. Think of it as the brand's character.

**Tone** is HOW the brand speaks in a given moment — formality, energy, technical depth. It adapts to context the way a person adjusts their tone when speaking to a friend vs. a CEO vs. a large audience.

## Voice Constants: "We Are / We Are Not"

The "We Are / We Are Not" table is the anchor of brand voice. It defines the brand's personality in paired attributes — what the brand IS and the boundary it should never cross.

### Structure

The table below is an illustrative example. During enforcement, use the "We Are / We Are Not" table from the user's own brand guidelines.

| We Are | We Are Not |
|--------|------------|
| **Confident** — we know our product and stand behind it | **Arrogant** — we never talk down to prospects or dismiss alternatives |
| **Approachable** — we make complex topics feel manageable | **Casual or sloppy** — approachable doesn't mean unprofessional |
| **Direct** — we get to the point quickly and clearly | **Blunt or aggressive** — directness includes empathy |
| **Data-driven** — we support claims with evidence | **Dry or academic** — data tells stories, not lectures |
| **Innovative** — we push boundaries and challenge status quo | **Hype-driven** — innovation is real, not buzzwords |

### How to Use During Enforcement

For every piece of content:
1. Check each "We Are" attribute — does the content reflect this?
2. Check each "We Are Not" boundary — does the content avoid crossing it?
3. If a boundary is crossed, revise the specific passage
4. If an attribute is missing, find a natural place to express it

Not every attribute needs to appear in every piece of content. Prioritize the 2-3 most relevant attributes for the content type and audience.

## Tone Flexes: The Three Dimensions

Tone adjusts along three independent dimensions:

### 1. Formality
How formal or casual the language is.

| Level | Signals | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| High | Complete sentences, industry terminology, structured format | Proposals, RFPs, enterprise comms |
| Medium | Clear and professional but conversational | Most emails, presentations, blog posts |
| Low | Casual language, contractions, personality shows through | Social media, internal comms, Slack |

### 2. Energy
How much enthusiasm, urgency, or dynamism the content conveys.

| Level | Signals | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| High | Active verbs, short sentences, exclamation-worthy excitement | Product launches, cold outreach hooks, social media |
| Medium | Steady pace, balanced between informative and engaging | Discovery content, follow-ups, case studies |
| Warm | Empathetic, supportive, understanding | Customer success, objection handling, bad news |
| Low | Measured, thoughtful, deliberate | Legal language, policy docs, sensitive topics |

### 3. Technical Depth
How much domain expertise or technical detail is included.

| Level | Signals | When |
|-------|---------|------|
| High | Technical terminology, architecture details, specs | Technical audience, implementation proposals, API docs |
| Medium | Industry terms explained when needed, features described clearly | Mixed audience, product demos, mid-funnel content |
| Low | Outcome-focused, benefits over features, no jargon | Executive audience, cold outreach, social media |

## Tone-by-Context Matrix

Combine the three dimensions for each content type:

| Context | Formality | Energy | Technical Depth | Key Principle |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Cold outreach | Medium | High | Low | Hook fast, earn attention |
| Discovery calls | Medium | Medium-High | Medium | Ask more than tell |
| Demo / presentation | Medium-High | High | High | Show, don't just describe |
| Enterprise proposal | High | Medium | High | ROI and precision |
| Follow-up email | Medium | Medium | Low-Medium | Add new value each touch |
| Social media | Low-Medium | High | Low | Brevity and personality |
| Customer success | Medium | Warm | Medium | Empathy and competence |
| Internal comms | Low | Medium | Varies | Authentic, less polished |

## Applying Voice + Tone Together

**Example: Cold outreach email**

Voice constants active:
- **Confident** — lead with a strong value claim
- **Direct** — get to the point in sentence one
- **Approachable** — don't sound like a robot

Tone settings:
- Formality: Medium (professional but not stiff)
- Energy: High (earn attention quickly)
- Technical Depth: Low (outcomes, not features)

**Example: Enterprise proposal**

Voice constants active:
- **Data-driven** — every claim has supporting evidence
- **Confident** — strong positioning without hedging
- **Innovative** — show forward-thinking approach

Tone settings:
- Formality: High (structured, complete sentences)
- Energy: Medium (measured, not breathless)
- Technical Depth: High (detailed implementation, specs)

## Common Enforcement Mistakes

1. **Applying all voice attributes at maximum intensity** — Not every attribute needs to shine in every sentence. Let 2-3 lead for the content type.
2. **Confusing voice with tone** — If the user asks for "casual" content, adjust TONE (lower formality, higher energy). Don't change VOICE (the brand's personality stays the same).
3. **Rigid enforcement over natural flow** — Guidelines are principles, not a checklist. Content should feel natural, not mechanically assembled.
4. **Ignoring the audience** — The same voice can sound very different to a CTO vs. a VP of Sales. Tone flexes handle this.
