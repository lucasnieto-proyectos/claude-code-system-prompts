# Before/After Content Examples

Concrete examples showing how brand voice enforcement transforms generic content into on-brand output. Each example shows the generic version, the enforced version, and annotations explaining what changed and why.

These examples use a fictional B2B SaaS company for illustration. During enforcement, replace all specifics (data points, product names, metrics) with data from the user's actual brand guidelines and context.

## Cold Outreach Email

### Before (Generic)
```
Subject: Quick question about your sales process

Hi [Name],

I wanted to reach out because I think our product could be a great fit
for your team. We offer an AI-powered platform that helps sales teams
be more productive.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to learn more?

Best,
[Sender]
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
Subject: [Company] is leaving pipeline on the table

Hi [Name],

Your team closed $12M last quarter — impressive. But our data shows
mid-market SaaS teams like yours typically lose 23% of qualified pipeline
to slow follow-ups.

[Product] fixes that. We help sales teams respond to buying signals in
real time, not hours later. [Customer X] saw their win rate jump 18%
in the first quarter.

Worth 15 minutes to see if the numbers apply to [Company]?

[Sender]
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Confident** — leads with a bold claim and specific data (not "I think our product could be")
- **Voice: Data-driven** — concrete numbers (23%, 18%, $12M) replace vague "more productive"
- **Voice: Direct** — gets to the point immediately, no "I wanted to reach out"
- **Tone: Energy HIGH** — active language, short sentences, urgency
- **Tone: Formality MEDIUM** — professional but conversational
- **Tone: Technical depth LOW** — outcomes and impact, not feature descriptions
- **Terminology**: "buying signals" and "pipeline" (industry-specific but accessible to VP Sales)

## Follow-Up Email

### Before (Generic)
```
Hi [Name],

Just following up on my previous email. I'd love to schedule a call
to discuss how we can help your team.

Let me know if you're available this week.

Thanks,
[Sender]

Hi [Name],

Quick update: we just published our Q4 benchmark report on enterprise
sales velocity. Three insights jumped out that are relevant to [Company]:

1. Teams using real-time signals close 31% faster than the industry average
2. The #1 pipeline killer isn't competition — it's response time
3. Mid-market wins are trending 15% larger when reps personalize within 2 hours

Happy to walk through how these benchmarks compare to your team's numbers.
The report is attached if you'd rather dig in yourself first.

[Sender]
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Data-driven** — new value in every touch (benchmark data), not just "following up"
- **Voice: Approachable** — offers two paths (call or self-serve) without pressure
- **Voice: Confident** — shares proprietary insights, positions as expert
- **Tone: Energy MEDIUM** — informative, not pushy
- **Tone: Formality MEDIUM** — professional but not stiff
- **Key principle applied**: "Add new value each touch" — no empty follow-ups

## Enterprise Proposal Executive Summary

### Before (Generic)
```
We are pleased to submit this proposal for your consideration. Our
company offers a comprehensive AI solution that can help improve your
sales team's performance. We believe our platform is the best choice
for organizations looking to modernize their sales operations.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
[Company] processes 2,400 leads per quarter with a 12-person sales team.
Current pipeline-to-close conversion sits at 18% — below the 24% benchmark
for enterprise SaaS at your ARR stage.

This proposal outlines how [Product] closes that gap. Our platform
analyzes buying signals across your existing tech stack and surfaces
the 3-5 daily actions most likely to advance each deal. Typical results:
+31% win rate, -40% time to close, 2.1x pipeline per rep.

Implementation takes 3 weeks. ROI breaks even at week 6.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Data-driven** — opens with the client's own metrics, not "we are pleased"
- **Voice: Direct** — no filler language, every sentence carries information
- **Voice: Confident** — specific outcomes with numbers, clear implementation timeline
- **Tone: Formality HIGH** — structured, precise language
- **Tone: Energy MEDIUM** — measured confidence, not hype
- **Tone: Technical depth HIGH** — specific features (buying signals, tech stack analysis), ROI math

## LinkedIn Post

### Before (Generic)
```
Excited to announce our new feature! We've been working hard on this
and we think it's going to change the way sales teams work. Check out
the link below to learn more! #sales #AI #innovation
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
The average sales rep spends 4.2 hours/day on tasks that don't close deals.

We analyzed 50,000 sales activities across 200 teams and found the pattern:
top performers aren't working harder — they're responding faster.

Today we're launching Signal Score: real-time prioritization that tells
your reps exactly which deal to work next, and why.

Early results from beta: 23% fewer lost deals from delayed follow-up.

Link in comments.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Data-driven** — opens with a statistic, not "excited to announce"
- **Voice: Confident** — specific research (50,000 activities, 200 teams)
- **Voice: Innovative** — describes what's new without hype
- **Voice: NOT hype-driven** — no "change the way sales teams work", replaced with measurable outcomes
- **Tone: Formality LOW-MEDIUM** — casual enough for LinkedIn, professional enough for B2B
- **Tone: Energy HIGH** — short sentences, bold opening stat
- **Tone: Technical depth LOW** — outcomes-focused, accessible to any reader
- **Terminology**: Avoided "revolutionary" and "game-changing" (prohibited terms)

## Internal Slack Message

### Before (Generic)
```
Hey team, just a reminder that we should all be using the approved
messaging when talking to prospects. Please refer to the brand
guidelines document for more information.
```

### After (Brand Voice Enforced)
```
Heads up — we updated the competitive positioning section in the brand
guidelines. Two big changes:

1. Against [Competitor]: lead with implementation speed (3 weeks vs. their 3 months)
2. Against Status Quo: new stat — teams using manual processes lose 23% of pipeline to timing

Updated doc is pinned in #sales-enablement. Questions? Tag me.
```

### What Changed
- **Voice: Direct** — specific changes, not vague "please refer to"
- **Voice: Data-driven** — concrete differentiators with numbers
- **Voice: Approachable** — casual, helpful tone appropriate for Slack
- **Tone: Formality LOW** — contractions, short sentences, "tag me"
- **Tone: Energy MEDIUM** — informative without being overly enthusiastic
- **Key principle**: Internal comms can be less polished, but voice attributes still apply

## Using These Examples

When enforcing brand voice, reference the relevant content type example to calibrate:
1. Match the content type to the closest example above
2. Note which voice attributes are most active for that type
3. Apply the tone settings (formality, energy, technical depth)
4. Check "We Are Not" boundaries — make sure content doesn't cross them
5. Verify terminology compliance (preferred terms used, prohibited terms absent)
