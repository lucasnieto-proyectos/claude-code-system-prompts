## If Connectors Available

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Pull new hire details and team org chart
- Auto-populate tools access list based on role

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Link to relevant onboarding docs, team wikis, and runbooks
- Pull the team's existing onboarding checklist to customize

If **~~calendar** is connected:
- Create Day 1 calendar events and Week 1 meeting invites automatically

## Tips

1. **Customize for the role** — An engineer's onboarding looks different from a designer's.
2. **Don't overload Day 1** — Focus on setup and relationships. Deep work starts Week 2.
3. **Assign a buddy** — Having a go-to person who isn't their manager makes a huge difference.
