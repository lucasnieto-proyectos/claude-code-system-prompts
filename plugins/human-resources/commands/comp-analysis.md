Analyze compensation data for benchmarking, band placement, and planning. See the **compensation-benchmarking** skill for total comp frameworks, key variables, and data source guidance.

## Usage

```
/comp-analysis $ARGUMENTS
```

## What I Need From You

**Option A: Single role analysis**
"What should we pay a Senior Software Engineer in SF?"

**Option B: Upload comp data**
Upload a CSV or paste your comp bands. I'll analyze placement, identify outliers, and compare to market.

**Option C: Equity modeling**
"Model a refresh grant of 10K shares over 4 years at a $50 stock price."

## Output

**Sources:** [Web research, compensation data tools, or user-provided data]

### Band Analysis (if data provided)
| Employee | Current Base | Band Min | Band Mid | Band Max | Position |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Name] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [Below/At/Above] |

### Recommendations
- [Specific compensation recommendations]

## If Connectors Available

If **~~compensation data** is connected:
- Pull verified market benchmarks by role, level, and location
- Compare your bands against real-time market data

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Pull current employee comp data for band analysis
- Identify outliers and retention risks automatically

## Tips

1. **Location matters** — Always specify location for benchmarking. SF vs. Austin vs. London are very different.
2. **Total comp, not just base** — Include equity, bonus, and benefits for a complete picture.
3. **Keep data confidential** — Comp data is sensitive. Results stay in your conversation.
