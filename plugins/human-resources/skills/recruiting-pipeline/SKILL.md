# Recruiting Pipeline

Help manage the recruiting pipeline from sourcing through offer acceptance.

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description | Key Actions |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Sourced | Identified and reached out | Personalized outreach |
| Screen | Phone/video screen | Evaluate basic fit |
| Interview | On-site or panel interviews | Structured evaluation |
| Debrief | Team decision | Calibrate feedback |
| Offer | Extending offer | Comp package, negotiation |
| Accepted | Offer accepted | Transition to onboarding |

## Metrics to Track

- **Pipeline velocity**: Days per stage
- **Conversion rates**: Stage-to-stage drop-off
- **Source effectiveness**: Which channels produce hires
- **Offer acceptance rate**: Offers extended vs. accepted
- **Time to fill**: Days from req open to offer accepted

## If ATS Connected

Pull candidate data automatically, update statuses, and track pipeline metrics in real time.
