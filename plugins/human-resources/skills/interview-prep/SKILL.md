# Interview Prep

Create structured interview plans to evaluate candidates consistently and fairly.

## Interview Design Principles

1. **Structured**: Same questions for all candidates in the role
2. **Competency-based**: Map questions to specific skills and behaviors
3. **Evidence-based**: Use behavioral and situational questions
4. **Diverse panel**: Multiple perspectives reduce bias
5. **Scored**: Use rubrics, not gut feelings

## Interview Plan Components

### Role Competencies
Define 4-6 key competencies for the role (e.g., technical skills, communication, leadership, problem-solving).

### Question Bank
For each competency, provide:
- 2-3 behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time...")
- 1-2 situational questions ("How would you handle...")
- Follow-up probes

### Scorecard
Rate each competency on a consistent scale (1-4) with clear descriptions of what each level looks like.

### Debrief Template
Structured format for interviewers to share findings and make a decision.

## Output

Produce a complete interview kit: panel assignment (who interviews for what), question bank by competency, scoring rubric, and debrief template.
