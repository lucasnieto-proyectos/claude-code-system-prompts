# Org Planning

Help plan organizational structure, headcount, and team design.

## Planning Dimensions

- **Headcount**: How many people do we need, in what roles, by when?
- **Structure**: Reporting lines, span of control, team boundaries
- **Sequencing**: Which hires are most critical? What's the right order?
- **Budget**: Headcount cost modeling and trade-offs

## Healthy Org Benchmarks

| Metric | Healthy Range | Warning Sign |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Span of control | 5-8 direct reports | < 3 or > 12 |
| Management layers | 4-6 for 500 people | Too many = slow decisions |
| IC-to-manager ratio | 6:1 to 10:1 | < 4:1 = top-heavy |
| Team size | 5-9 people | < 4 = lonely, > 12 = hard to manage |

## Output

Produce org charts (text-based), headcount plans with cost modeling, and sequenced hiring roadmaps. Flag structural issues like single points of failure or excessive management overhead.
