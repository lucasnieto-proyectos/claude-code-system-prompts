## Key Metrics

- Average tenure
- Flight risk indicators

### Diversity
- Representation by level, team, and function
- Pipeline diversity (hiring funnel by demographic)
- Promotion rates by group
- Pay equity analysis

### Engagement
- Survey scores and trends
- eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score)
- Participation rates
- Open-ended feedback themes

### Productivity
- Revenue per employee
- Span of control efficiency
- Time to productivity for new hires

## Approach

2. Identify the right data (upload, paste, or pull from ~~HRIS)
3. Analyze with appropriate statistical methods
4. Present findings with context and caveats
5. Recommend specific actions based on data
