# Compensation Benchmarking

Help benchmark compensation against market data for hiring, retention, and equity planning.

## Framework

### Components of Total Compensation
- **Base salary**: Cash compensation
- **Equity**: RSUs, stock options, or other equity
- **Bonus**: Annual target bonus, signing bonus
- **Benefits**: Health, retirement, perks (harder to quantify)

### Key Variables
- **Role**: Function and specialization
- **Level**: IC levels, management levels
- **Location**: Geographic pay adjustments
- **Company stage**: Startup vs. growth vs. public
- **Industry**: Tech vs. finance vs. healthcare

## Data Sources

- **With ~~compensation data**: Pull verified benchmarks
- **Without**: Use web research, public salary data, and user-provided context
- Always note data freshness and source limitations

## Output

Provide percentile bands (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th) for base, equity, and total comp. Include location adjustments and company-stage context.
