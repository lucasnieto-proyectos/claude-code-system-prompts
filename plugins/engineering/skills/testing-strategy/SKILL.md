# Testing Strategy

Design effective testing strategies balancing coverage, speed, and maintenance.

## Testing Pyramid

```
        /  E2E  \         Few, slow, high confidence
       / Integration \     Some, medium speed
      /    Unit Tests  \   Many, fast, focused
```

## Strategy by Component Type

- **API endpoints**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for HTTP layer, contract tests for consumers
- **Data pipelines**: Input validation, transformation correctness, idempotency tests
- **Frontend**: Component tests, interaction tests, visual regression, accessibility
- **Infrastructure**: Smoke tests, chaos engineering, load tests

## What to Cover

Focus on: business-critical paths, error handling, edge cases, security boundaries, data integrity.

Skip: trivial getters/setters, framework code, one-off scripts.

## Output

Produce a test plan with: what to test, test type for each area, coverage targets, and example test cases. Identify gaps in existing coverage.
