Review code changes with a structured lens on security, performance, correctness, and maintainability.

## Usage

```
/review <PR URL or file path>
```

Review the provided code changes: @$1

If no specific file or URL is provided, ask what to review.

## How It Works

## Review Checklist

See the **code-review** skill for detailed guidance on security patterns, performance anti-patterns, and maintainability heuristics.

I check for:
- **Security**: SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass, secrets in code, insecure deserialization
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, algorithmic complexity, missing indexes
- **Correctness**: Edge cases, null handling, race conditions, error propagation
- **Maintainability**: Naming clarity, single responsibility, test coverage, documentation

## If Connectors Available

If **~~source control** is connected:
- Pull the PR diff automatically from the URL
- Check CI status and test results

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link findings to related tickets
- Verify the PR addresses the stated requirements

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Check changes against team coding standards and style guides

## Tips

1. **Provide context** — "This is a hot path" or "This handles PII" helps me focus.
2. **Specify concerns** — "Focus on security" narrows the review.
3. **Include tests** — I'll check test coverage and quality too.
