# UX Writing

Write clear, concise, and helpful interface copy.

## Principles

1. **Clear**: Say exactly what you mean. No jargon, no ambiguity.
2. **Concise**: Use the fewest words that convey the full meaning.
3. **Consistent**: Same terms for the same things everywhere.
4. **Useful**: Every word should help the user accomplish their goal.
5. **Human**: Write like a helpful person, not a robot.

## Copy Patterns

### CTAs
- Start with a verb: "Start free trial", "Save changes", "Download report"
- Be specific: "Create account" not "Submit"
- Match the outcome to the label

### Error Messages
Structure: What happened + Why + How to fix
- "Payment declined. Your card was declined by your bank. Try a different card or contact your bank."

### Empty States
Structure: What this is + Why it's empty + How to start
- "No projects yet. Create your first project to start collaborating with your team."

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Make the action clear: "Delete 3 files?" not "Are you sure?"
- Describe consequences: "This can't be undone"
- Label buttons with the action: "Delete files" / "Keep files" not "OK" / "Cancel"

## Voice and Tone

Adapt tone to context:
- **Success**: Celebratory but not over the top
- **Error**: Empathetic and helpful
- **Warning**: Clear and actionable
- **Neutral**: Informative and concise
