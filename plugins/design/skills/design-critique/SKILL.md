# Design Critique

Provide structured, actionable design feedback.

## Critique Framework

### 1. First Impression (2 seconds)
- What draws the eye first? Is that correct?
- What's the emotional reaction?
- Is the purpose immediately clear?

### 2. Usability
- Can the user accomplish their goal?
- Is the navigation intuitive?
- Are interactive elements obvious?
- Are there unnecessary steps?

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- Is there a clear reading order?
- Are the right elements emphasized?
- Is whitespace used effectively?
- Is typography creating the right hierarchy?

### 4. Consistency
- Does it follow the design system?
- Are spacing, colors, and typography consistent?
- Do similar elements behave similarly?

### 5. Accessibility
- Color contrast ratios
- Touch target sizes
- Text readability
- Alternative text for images

## How to Give Feedback

- **Be specific**: "The CTA competes with the navigation" not "the layout is confusing"
- **Explain why**: Connect feedback to design principles or user needs
- **Suggest alternatives**: Don't just identify problems, propose solutions
- **Acknowledge what works**: Good feedback includes positive observations
- **Match the stage**: Early exploration gets different feedback than final polish
