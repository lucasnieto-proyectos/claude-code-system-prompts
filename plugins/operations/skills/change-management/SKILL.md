# Change Management

Help plan and execute changes that affect people, processes, or technology.

## Change Management Framework

### 1. Assess
- What is changing?
- Who is affected?
- How significant is the change? (Low / Medium / High)
- What resistance should we expect?

### 2. Plan
- Communication plan (who, what, when, how)
- Training plan (what skills are needed, how to deliver)
- Support plan (help desk, champions, FAQs)
- Timeline with milestones

### 3. Execute
- Announce and explain the "why"
- Train and support
- Monitor adoption
- Address resistance

### 4. Sustain
- Measure adoption and effectiveness
- Reinforce new behaviors
- Address lingering issues
- Document lessons learned

## Communication Principles

- Explain the **why** before the **what**
- Communicate early and often
- Use multiple channels
- Acknowledge what's being lost, not just what's being gained
- Provide a clear path for questions and concerns

## Output

Produce a change management plan with communication timeline, stakeholder impact analysis, training plan, and resistance mitigation strategies.
