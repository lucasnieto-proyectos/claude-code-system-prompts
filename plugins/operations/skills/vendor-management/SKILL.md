# Vendor Management

Help evaluate, compare, and manage vendor relationships.

## Evaluation Framework

### Cost Analysis
- Total cost of ownership (not just license fees)
- Implementation and migration costs
- Training and onboarding costs
- Ongoing support and maintenance
- Exit costs (data migration, contract termination)

### Risk Assessment
- Vendor financial stability
- Security and compliance posture
- Concentration risk (single vendor dependency)
- Contract lock-in and exit terms
- Business continuity and disaster recovery

### Performance Metrics
- SLA compliance
- Support response times
- Uptime and reliability
- Feature delivery cadence
- Customer satisfaction

## Comparison Matrix

When comparing vendors, produce a side-by-side matrix covering: pricing, features, integrations, security, support, contract terms, and references.

## Output

Provide a clear recommendation with supporting evidence. Always flag risks and negotiation leverage points.
