# Resource Planning

Help plan and optimize resource allocation across projects and teams.

## Planning Dimensions

### People
- Available headcount and skills
- Current allocation and utilization
- Planned hires and timeline
- Contractor and vendor capacity

### Budget
- Operating budget by category
- Project-specific budgets
- Variance tracking
- Forecast vs. actual

### Time
- Project timelines and dependencies
- Critical path analysis
- Buffer and contingency planning
- Deadline management

## Utilization Targets

| Role Type | Target Utilization | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| IC / Specialist | 75-80% | Leave room for reactive work and growth |
| Manager | 60-70% | Management overhead, meetings, 1:1s |
| On-call / Support | 50-60% | Interrupt-driven work is unpredictable |

## Common Pitfalls

- Planning to 100% utilization (no buffer for surprises)
- Ignoring meeting load and context-switching costs
- Not accounting for vacation, holidays, and sick time
- Treating all hours as equal (creative work ≠ admin work)

## Output

Produce allocation plans, utilization dashboards, scenario analyses (what if we hire / don't hire / deprioritize), and staffing recommendations.
