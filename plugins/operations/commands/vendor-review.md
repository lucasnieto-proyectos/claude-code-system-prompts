## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing vendor evaluations, contracts, and performance reviews
- Pull procurement policies and approval thresholds

If **~~procurement** is connected:
- Pull current contract terms, spend history, and renewal dates
- Compare pricing against existing vendor agreements

## Tips

1. **Upload the proposal** — I can extract pricing, terms, and SLAs from vendor documents.
2. **Compare vendors** — "Compare Vendor A vs Vendor B" gets you a side-by-side analysis.
3. **Include current spend** — For renewals, knowing what you pay now helps evaluate price changes.
