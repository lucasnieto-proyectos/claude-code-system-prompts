## If Connectors Available

If **~~ITSM** is connected:
- Create the change request ticket automatically
- Pull change advisory board schedule and approval workflows

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link to related implementation tasks and dependencies
- Track change progress against milestones

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Draft stakeholder notifications for the communication plan
- Post change updates to the relevant team channels

## Tips

1. **Be specific about impact** — "Everyone" is not an impact assessment. "200 users in the billing team" is.
2. **Always have a rollback plan** — Even if you're confident, plan for failure.
3. **Communicate early** — Surprises create resistance. Previews create buy-in.
