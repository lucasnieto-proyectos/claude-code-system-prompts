## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing runbooks to update rather than create from scratch
- Publish the completed runbook to your ops wiki

If **~~ITSM** is connected:
- Link the runbook to related incident types and change requests
- Auto-populate escalation contacts from on-call schedules

## Tips

1. **Be painfully specific** — "Run the script" is not a step. "Run `python sync.py --prod --dry-run` from the ops server" is.
2. **Include failure modes** — What can go wrong at each step and what to do about it.
3. **Test the runbook** — Have someone unfamiliar with the process follow it. Fix where they get stuck.
